# Lab 4 - JavaScript
This lab features 3 different problems on one web page.

Link: https://cs.torontomu.ca/~avallipu/lab04/lab04.html 

## Problem 1
This problem uses JavaScript to validate form items. Creating a form that asks users for their name, address, and phone number, the JS script ensures items are formated correctly (i.e. postal code is L1L1L1 format, phone number is (416) 555-5555 format, and email is example@domain.com). Then, by clicking a validation button, it changes the phone number format to 416-555-5555 and displays all the information in a separate section.
