    <div style="background-color: #f4f1de; text-align: justify; padding: 40px 60px; font-size: 18px";>
        <p>For this lab, I created two versions of the same website about Baltimore, Maryland. One uses CSS media queries and the other Used the Bootstrap framework. <br><br></p>
        <p>Since this is my first time making a responsive page, my biggest challenge when using both frameworks is manipulating images. My initial deisgn was based on my laptop screen and so redesigning it to match a smaller width while still maintaining the general theme and layout was quite difficult and time consuming when I first did the CSS media queries portion. I wasn't sure what the best approach to choosing appropriate heights and layouts (for example, changing a 2x2 photo grid to 4 individual rows), so I spent a lot of time experimenting. <br><br></p>
        <p>On the other hand, I had an easier time with responsive design using Bootstrap thanks to the row and col selectors. I could easily design the website to respond to different widths by just using the built-in selector, saving me a lot of time and headaches. It was also fun to test out some of the features like the nav bars they provide. However, I struggled a lot more with image manipulation because I became more adjusted to how media queries work and was unfamilar with the Bootstrap documentation. <br><br></p>
        <p>Overall, I enjoyed the Bootstrap framework more, but if I were to create another responsive page, I would use Bootstrap for general layouts and media queries for images (until I become more familiar with Bootstrap). <br><br></p>
